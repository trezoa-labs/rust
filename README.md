# Fork of the Rust Programming Language that supports Berkley Packet Filter (BPF) targets

This fork of Rust contains changes that enable rustc to build BPF
modules.  It depends on a customized
[fork](https://github.com/trezoa-xyz/llvm-project) of Rust's LLVM
fork.

Trezoa SDK does not depend directly on this repo.  Instead [platform-tools]
builds and releases binary packages that the Trezoa SDK pulls in.

[platform-tools]: https://github.com/trezoa-xyz/platform-tools

BPF modules are built using target triple `bpfel-unknown-unknown`
which represents the little endian version of BPF.  There is no
support for big endian at this time.

Upgrading the compiler and standard library source tree
-------------------------------------------------------

The source tree has two external dependencies
1. [compiler-builtins]
2. [llvm-project]

If any of the depencies is changed or this repository is updated to
make a new release of the bpf-tools, tag the dependencies, and this
repository with a new bpf-tools-v1.x tag, so that all components of
the released bpf-tools have the same tag, e.g. bpf-tools-v1.6. Thus,
release of every version of the bpf-tools is fully specified by the
release version.

The [llvm-project] is a submodule of this repository, therefore its
version is explicitly committed in this repository.  However,
[compiler-builtins] is pulled in as a cargo package.  Therefore, it is
necessary to update the `[patch.crates-io]` subsection of the
top-level `Cargo.toml` file, and specify which tag must be used to
pull the correct version of [compiler-builtins].

After this repository is tagged for a new release, update the
`bpf-tools/build.sh` in [bpf-tools] repository to pull the correct
version of the rust repository and make a new release tag in
[bpf-tools] repository.

## Why Rust?

- **Performance:** Fast and memory-efficient, suitable for critical services, embedded devices, and easily integrated with other languages.

- **Reliability:** Our rich type system and ownership model ensure memory and thread safety, reducing bugs at compile-time.

- **Productivity:** Comprehensive documentation, a compiler committed to providing great diagnostics, and advanced tooling including package manager and build tool ([Cargo]), auto-formatter ([rustfmt]), linter ([Clippy]) and editor support ([rust-analyzer]).
